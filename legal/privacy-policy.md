# Privacy Policy

The privacy of your data is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why and how your data is handled. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy applies to our website (https://aidmin.io) and the application (https://app.aidmin.io).

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:

### Identity & Access

When you sign up for Aidmin, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and later, a company name. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Billing information

When you pay for Aidmin, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number and as-of billing address, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States or VAT in the EU, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.

### Usage data

When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services. We blind all of these individual identifiers after 30 days.

## When we access or share your information

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we'll ever access or share your info are:

_To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission._ If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

_To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses_. Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

_When required under applicable law._

Aidmin, Inc is a Canadian company and all data infrastructure are located in the US.

- If US law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we'll always inform you when such requests are made. In the event a government authority outside the US approaches Aidmin with a request, our default stance is to refuse unless the US government compels us to comply through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. _We have never received a National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) order._
- Similarly, if Aidmin receives a request to preserve data, we refuse unless compelled by either the US Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f) or a properly served US subpoena for civil matters. In both of these situations, we have to comply. In these situations, we notify affected customers as soon as possible unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. We do not share preserved data unless absolutely required under the Stored Communications Act or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we destroy any preserved copies we made of customer data once the preservation period lapses.
- If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.
  Finally, if Aidmin Inc. is acquired by or merged with another company — we don't plan on that, but if it happens — we'll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
